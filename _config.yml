# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.
#
# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

#
# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site and can be found in the .env file.
# If you look in the HTML files, you will see them accessed via {{ site.env.TITLE }},
# {{ site.env.EMAIL }}, and so on. You can create any custom variable you would like,
# and they will be accessible in the templates via {{ site.env.MYVARIABLE }}.
